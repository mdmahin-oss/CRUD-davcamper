# CRUD-davcamper
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It demonstrates how to set up RESTful APIs, connect to a MongoDB database, and handle HTTP requests for managing data. The project serves as a foundation for more complex applications such as blogs, e-commerce platforms, or dashboards.
